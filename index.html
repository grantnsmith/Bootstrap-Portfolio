                  Growing up I never thought of myself as technically inclined. But thinking back to high school I do remember teaching myself
                  how to add games to my T-480 graphing calculator and then transferring the games to my friends calculators. A year or so after college I 
                  got a job part-time at the Apple Store and part-time at REI. I planned on the Apple Store being temporary until I got a full time position
                  at REI. Quickly recognizing that the tech field offered better pay and career advancement, I decided to go all into tech.

                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p>
                        I worked my way up to a full-time Apple Genius position and that turned into a position as the director of IT at a private school. After
                        being there for a couple years, I decided to put my technical career on hold to pursue a dream I had since college, to be a rock climbing guide.
                        On weekends I practiced and studied until I passed my climbing guide certification course. I worked for two years in the mountains of California 
                        as a rock climbing guide.

                        Nearing 30, my focus changed to future plans of a family, and a more tradtiional career path was appealing. Reaching out to contacts in the tech world,
                        I was able to transition back into the tech world as a System Admin at Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Wanting to "level up" in the tech field I signed 
                        up for a full-stack web development course through the Univeristy of Washington.
